    <div class="about-text">
      <p>  We like to joke that Fox and Chance's love for baseball is hereditary. Not only are mom and dad big baseball fans but their grandfather
             was a former minor league player. Baseball is life. Baseball has been life since they were five years old in tee-ball running the 
             wrong way down the baseline and dancing in the field. Fast forward four years and baseball still fills the household every given 
             second of any given day in the Davis home. Chance has become an avid pitcher and center fielder, while Fox has excelled at pitching and shortstop. 
             Their love for baseball doesn't just stop on the field. They came up with a tee shirt business idea one day with their dad. With their fathers 
             support and help, they got to work right away. That is how Ace and Dinger was born, with the goal of redefining casual baseball gear and making it 
             available for all. Ace and Dinger makes custom and personalized clothing for the baseball lover in your life.
